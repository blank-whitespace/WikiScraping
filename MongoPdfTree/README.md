#MongoPdfTree
This is a auxillary app created to take whatever data you have and create a tree of all the pdfs in your given mongo db collection.
It has been stripped of it's original mongo string and collection data, however the path to the folder and the folder structure I used,
still exists in the py file itself,on line 26 

There is no functionality outside of the folder creation, it exists just to form data suitable for the llama index model to digest
