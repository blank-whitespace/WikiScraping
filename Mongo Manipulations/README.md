#Mongo Manipulations
This auxillary app is used to make large scale collection changes in mongoDB, with the connection string removed for obvious reasons
Currently it is written to change the Grade column to a list with ["9"]
in it, if you make a mistake while extracting data on a large scale,you can possibly make changes using this app
