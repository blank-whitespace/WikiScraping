#NLPScraper
This is an auxillary app created to scan the first couple paragraphs of a wikipedia page and to get the first 15 images from the WikiMedia Commons pages on the same topic
It is a python file you can import and pass entities to, to make your code modular, there are some limitations to it since it only picks up the data that it can find available readily,
and it doesn't check for the data's accuracy, you might get disambiguation pages or pages with no content whatsoever or even pages that don't exist, all these cases are handled only by printing,
any attempts to catch these undesirable cases can be made in your main app
